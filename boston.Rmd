## 2 INTRODUCTION

This project uses a public dataset named "Boston" from the R package - MASS. This dataset studies the effects of a range of variables on median house prices in Boston near late 70s, United States. 

I will statistically analyse the dataset with machine learning algorithms to find out the effects of each variables on the median house prices and build a model that correctly predict the median house price.
